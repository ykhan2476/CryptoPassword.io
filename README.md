# CryptoPassword.io
This is a password management project that utilizes RSA encryption for storing and retrieving passwords securely. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter, a Python library for creating GUI applications.

The objective of this project is to offer a secure solution for managing passwords by encrypting them with RSA encryption. Users can save their passwords along with a unique key, and retrieve them later using the same key.

Key Features of the Project:
1)RSA Encryption: Utilizes RSA encryption for securing passwords, providing a high level of security.
2)Graphical User Interface (GUI): Offers a user-friendly interface built using Tkinter, making it easy for users to interact with the application.
3)Password Saving: Allows users to save passwords along with a unique key for encryption.
4)Password Retrieval: Enables users to retrieve their passwords by providing the username and the corresponding unique key.
5)Show All Saved Passwords: Provides an option to display all saved passwords in a table format for easy reference.

Technologies and Tools used:
• Tkinter
• Python
• Jupyter Notebook
